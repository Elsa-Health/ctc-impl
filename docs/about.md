# About

Elsa for CTC project is created to support the Community Healthcare workers (CHW) and doctors (healthcare providers) and make it possible for them to properly attend treat and care for PLWA.

The project looks to:

-   Improve the effectiveness of health care providers to take care of PLWA
-   Lower the barrier of entry in tech for health

To do this, the considerations put to place are:

-   To present a simple interface over common device that can be used by health care workers and doctors
-   Increase the information flow between health care providers
-   Make device operational even when there's no internet connection (or in our case, once in 2 weeks)

### Highlevel Architecture

To achieve such an implementation, we've decided to build a **mobile application** to work with a device most familiar with all of the health care provider we'd pilot and support.

We'd include the mobile application will be a part of a system where the programs are choreographed to share information amongst the devices. With this, and element we thought to be useful is a **synchronization device** that would assist in the sharing of information between the devices.
